Pro6pp Wordpress/WooCommerce Plugin
===================================

This repository contains the files of the pro6pp Wordpress plugin.

The plugin is dependant on WooCommerce since it targets the address form fields generated by WooCommerce.

Build Status: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dcentralize/pro6pp-wordpress.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dcentralize/pro6pp-wordpress)

## Requirements:

This plugin requires the following to be already installed and configured in order to function as expected.

- An accessible wordpress site that you have administration rights to.
- WooCommerce plugin to be installed and activated on that site.

## How to install:

* Clone the repository with either option
 * `git clone`
 * `zip file of the repository, provided by github`
 * [zip file with only the required files](https://github.com/dcentralize/pro6pp-wordpress/zipball/stable)
     - Can be installed directly on WordPress via the `Plugin->Add New` section.
* Extract or Copy the files into a new/empty folder and assign to that folder an appropriate name (for example, `pro6pp`).
* Copy or Upload the folder inside the wordpress' plugin folder (ie: `myWordPressSite/wp-content/plugins/`).
* Activate the plugin by visiting the administration page of your wordpress site and selecting to activate the pro6pp plugin.

## How to use:

* Navigate to a WooCommerce's form field that requires address input.
* Fill in your postcode.
* Fill in your streetnumber.
* Continue editing the rest of the fields.
* The address related fields will be autocompleted automatically into the appropriate form fields.

## Contributing:

If you would like to contribute to the project, you are more than welcome.
Here are some guidelines to keep in mind.

### Guidelines
* Follow the conventions that are used in the files.
* Spaces are preferred than tabs.
* Document your code.
* Test and lint your code first before submitting a pull request.

### Testing
Tests are important and currently missing.
We use Travis CI to run our tests and have created a basic structure to do that.

#### Test Structure
Tests are found inside the `tests` folder.

In the root of the test folder are:
* The php unit tests, These will run by travis with `phpunit`
* The `js_tests` folder that contains the javascript tests, for the frontend, these tests run with `casperjs`.
* Configuration files

The php test files should always start with the `test_` prefix, where the javascript test files should be alphabetically ordered if execution order is important.

The configuration files in the root are used to configure `TravisCI`, `Grunt` and `NodeJs`. These files are used to configure all the dependencies and tools required for the test run.

### Plugin Structure
`pro6pp_autocomplete.php`:
That is the main file that when accessed by wordpress internals, initialises the pro6pp plugin.
In this file global functions and variables can be defined for use with the pro6pp plugin. This file is the starting point of the plugin.

`pro6pp.php`:
This is the main class of the plugin.
When initialised, it hooks itself into the appropriate wordpress execution triggers. It implements all functionality required to communicate with the pro6pp service and the wordpress client.

`settings.php`: This is the Settings class. It is initialised when the Pro6pp class is initialised and is responsible for saving, retrieving and displaying the pro6pp settings as defined by the administrator in the administration pages.

`templates`:
This folder contains HTML template files (php and html combined). These are used when the plugin needs to output static information as a response. These templates are currently used only by the `Settings` class and output information to the administration pages.
